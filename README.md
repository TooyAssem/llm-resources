# Resources to get started with Large Language Models (LLMs)

- To be clear, this is not a roadmap for `getting started` with LLMs.
- I am not covering the books you should study, university studies, certificates, etc.
- I assume you have basic understanding of NLP stuffs, programming knowledge ( mainly Python and Maths ).
  - You might argue, why Maths as everything is automated. Well, well, behind the scene, almost everything is Maths ðŸ§  )
  - Calculus, Probability, Linear Algebra
  - You need to know, Lets say what is matrix, how dot product works, etc etc.
- These are some of the resources which I suggest you to get started.
- After knowing the basics and how things work, it's upon you, what to do ( Or lets say if it's your cup of tea / coffee or not )
> Remember one thing, using LLMs and implementing are two different things, you need not necessary know how to implement, but you need to know how to use it in right way.

## Frameworks which I have explored untill now, there are many, you can give a try ( your world, your rules )
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
  - [All you need to know about LangChain](https://youtu.be/EIejozA1W7I?si=rPBJnh7uEWVRa8ce)
- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
  - [All you need to know about LlamaIndex](https://youtu.be/FbQowFipEP4?si=GIZI73RzJZy1B_cj)

## Google, Microsoft and AWS has their own courses ( you can pick the one where you want to start)
## OpenAI has really good [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) and [Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/)

## Youtube ( Free University )
- There is unlimited knoweledge you can grasp, try to find the best ones and follow them instead of jumping among videos.
- Main thing is to understand things and try it yourself. Unless you try (practice youself), you won't learn.
- I have videos on LLMs with playlist on langchain, chainlit and Llamaindex. Many LLMs videos to follow in 2024
  - [Langchain playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-qytj7eIWVd1a5SsQ1dzOjVDHdgC1Ck&si=UsnrzCA1kUsYLtLe)
  - [LlamaIndex playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-qytj7eIWWqLRAJh-Q_fuvs0qH739zz&si=ljn51QFH4qbFL3uz)

> Main thing I want to highlight, practice practice and practice, take help with AI assistants ðŸ‘‡
 
# AI Assistants ( Remember, personal use or enterprise use )
- [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai/pro?referral_code=YAWB6JNV) --> let's put this way, it's Google Search with LLMs with it.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) --> Based on your need, free or paid version. ( Team, Enterprise , etc)
- [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) , Bing Enterprise.
- [Hugging Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat/)
